# Setup your system

The scenario uses [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) as well as [Gazebo 7](http://gazebosim.org/blog/gazebo7).
Therefore it has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 (*Xenial Xerus*).

You can choose between two different approaches for getting the necessary packages:

* [install binary packages](../install_binary/readme.md) (recommended)
* [build from source](../install_source/readme.md)

Afterwards you can test your setup by [running an example](../run_example/readme.md).
