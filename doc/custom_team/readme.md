# Create and run your own team

A template repository provides an easy way to getting starting with programming your own team.
First you have to fork the following repository: <https://github.com/osrf/TO-BE-CREATED>

* [Program your own team](../program_team/readme.md)

  This tutorial will walk you through the template as well as guide you how to write your own team controller.

Once you have a draft ready you can choose between two different approaches to run your own team:

* [Run locally](../run_locally/readme.md)
* [Run in the cloud](../run_cloud/readme.md)
